      <description>Hi I&amp;rsquo;m Ramón. As an engineer I love solving complex problems, especially if I play in a motivated team. I also enjoy learning new things, I&amp;rsquo;m not afraid of new technologies and challenges. I&amp;rsquo;m really picky and I prefer to take my time to find solutions that are reliable and maintainable in the long term. Watching YouTube videos is my favorite entertainment, especially gadget reviews and unboxings.</description>
