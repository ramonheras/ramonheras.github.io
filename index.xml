      <description>Hi My name is RamÃ³n Heras. I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineer that loves solving complex problems, especially as part of a motivated team ðŸ™Œ. I also enjoy learning new things; new technologies and challenges don&amp;rsquo;t hold me back. Since I&amp;rsquo;m pretty picky, I prefer to take my time to find reliable and maintainable solutions in the long term; system architecture design is fascinating, innit? Watching YouTube videos is my favorite entertainment, mainly gadget reviews and unboxings.</description>
